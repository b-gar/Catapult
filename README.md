### Shiny Application: https://bengarski.shinyapps.io/Catapult/

#### Requirements: CSV files to upload into the Shiny App, exported from [Catapult Open Field](https://openfield.catapultsports.com/)
* CSV files can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/blg-uwm/Catapult/tree/master/Catapult%20Demo%20Files) for testing out the app

This app is for visualizing past practice and game positioning systems data from Catapult Wearable Technologies. This specifically can monitor player load, distance (including high speed distance), max velocity, as well as ACWR. This was created for Marquette University Sports Performance but may be used by anyone.

ACWR: Acute-Chronic Workload Ratio is used in this app to monitor injury risk of athletes and to give notifications when they are most susceptible. Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is used to better account for the effects of training on an athlete.
